# Intro

![Project Photo](Photos/complete_unit.jpg)

Abnormal synchronization of neuronal activity in dopaminergic circuits is related to motor impairment in Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD). Vibrotactile coordinated reset (vCR) fingertip stimulation aims to counteract excessive synchronization and induce sustained unlearning of pathologic synaptic connectivity and neuronal synchrony.

Vibrotactile Coordinated Reset delivers vibratory stimulation to the fingertips of each hand. A specific pattern of vibration to each fingertip is delivered which theoretically disrupts abnormal synchrony in the brain.

I reverse-engineered the Stanford Vibrotactile Coordinated Reset (vCR) Glove. This project provides instructions to build your own vCR Glove. Including Bill of Materials, Instructions, CAD Files, Circuit Board design files, and Firmware.

# Control Box

## Build Steps
1) You will need to have a manufacturer create the Printed Circuit Boards (PCB). Upload the Gerber file: Control_Box\Electronics\Control_Box_Gerber.zip.  I recommend having your circuit board assembled with all the components. Use the PickAndPlace, and BOM files for assembly. I used JLCPCB.com.
2) You will also need to order parts. See the Bill of Materials.
3) You will need to solder on the Feather Microcontroller, Screen, and Boost Converter. These parts are easy to solder 2.54 through hole components.
4) You will need to solder on the switch to the two pins labeled EN+ and EN-.
5) You will need to cut a hole for the switch, and cut a slot for the USB charging cable. These cuts may be made with hand tools. You may also find laser cutter dxf files in Control_Box/Case_Assembly.
6) You will need to flash the provided firmware onto the Feather Microcontroller. Use the Arduino IDE and a USB cable. See Firmware.

# Glove Hardware

![Project Photo](Photos/gloves_detail.jpg)

## Build Steps
1) You will need to send the Printed Circuit Board (PCB) design files to a manufacturer. I recommend having your circuit board assembled with all the components. Upload the Gerber file (Glove_Hardware/Electronics/Glove_Gerber.zip) when prompted for a Gerber file.
2) Create cables by soldering or crimping the JST Cables onto the ERM Vibration Motor cables. You will need to make 8 cable/motor assemblies.
3) Create the motor/finger mounts. This uses double sided velcro stips. The ERM Vibration Motor and cable is placed between two strips, and sewed at the ends. A third piece of velcro strip is used around the finger to ensure a snug fit. You will need to make 8 motor/finger mounts.
4) Cut and attach velcro strips to the glove so that they align with each finger on the glove. Recommend sewing the velcro strips to the gloves, and using adhesive.
5) Leaving extra length for hand movements. Using 1/2-inch Paracord, sew the circuit board to the gloves.
6) Plug the cable assemblies into to the circuit board.
7) Plug an ethernet cable between the glove and control box.
8) Optional. You can 3D print covers for the circuit boards. See Glove_Hardware/glove_PCB_cover.stl.

# Display Case (optional)

![Project Photo](Photos/display_case.jpg)

## Build Steps
1) Assemble the case using the provided components.
2) Mount the Mannequin Hand Display Stands to the board. I used two screws in each hand.
3) There is a stand for the Control Box which can be 3D printed. See Display_Case_Hardware\control_box_holder.stl. I used three screws to mount the control box holder.
